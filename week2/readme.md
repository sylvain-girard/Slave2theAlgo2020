# stuff we did in week 2

## self-algorithm 

The first 'self-algorithm' I tried involved what would normally be my morning coffee, except that I included five other options to be determined by a dice roll. Luckily for me, I rolled a four which was the coffee option. I then used a dice again to determine thhe strength of the coffee. I'm definitely someone who prefers their coffee strong so I was disappointed to only roll a three :(. A follow-up coffee was much needed.

## playing around with Processing to achieve some basic interactivity 

We began trying out some basic code in the Processing program in order to achieve some basic interactive sketches. I found it to be pretty perplexing to begin with, because i'd only ever hhad experience with HTML and CSS so thhis was quite different. The results were being able to draw using shapes in the sketch, by following thhe mouse position. We also used the mouse position to determine the colour.

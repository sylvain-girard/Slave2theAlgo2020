# stuff we did in week 4

## processing hunt & gather

I chose this sketch by [Vamoss](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/913474) because I like that it combines the kinetic typography trend in a 3d way, with interactivity, being able to move the text around as if it was a 3d object. The use of the mouse pointer almost like a torch light was also great.

## processing

### working in processing with images

This was when we first started to use images in Processing, and about how to use the image data to do various things. We first created a sort of colour-picker that detects the colour at the mouse location and creates a circle in that colour. Then we took this a bit further, creating randomised generative cirles spawning on pixels in their respective colours. I saw this as being very useful, as of course you could keep the colour data from the image just as colour data, or you could turn that data into something else, like sound for example.

### working in processing with text

We also began working with text in Processing, which I guess proved to be a little more complex than I was imagining. I found that the visual quality of the text was actually quite low which will probably effect the direction I go for my project.

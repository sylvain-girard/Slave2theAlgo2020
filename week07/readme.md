# week 7

## working on my project

This was a small development on the week 6 task. I was just playing around with getting multiple shapes driven by the amplitude at different factors. I found that just multiplying the value of the amplitude wasn't resulting in the more 'exponential growth' effect I imagined, so I will keep trying different ways.

This was just an example of using FFT (frequency) as well as FFT Waveform to drive some shapes. I watched a lot of Daniel Shiffman's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4) on the subject as well as reading the information in the [p5Js sound guide](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT). From here it is just a matter of extracting various sectors of the frequecy so I can use it to represent bass and treble (as well as the ones in between if I can figure it out), and affect some other visual elements.

## weekly research

This week I was focused on trying to find ways of creating the visuals that I wanted in my project, or at least somethhing that looked similar that I could look through the code and get an idea. I started on Open Processing site and found a couple of great examples for the 'blobs' in the centre of my sketch, one by [Sayama](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/816453), and one by [Roni Kaufman](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/839679), who both seem to be have an abundance of various projects on the site.

## hour of code

This week involved some more type-based coding and being able to assign various effects to words or letters. Towards the end we also went over assigning key commands from the keyboard, whichh was easier than I expected. The result was being able to write text that moves around randomly and over time could eventually become illegible.

## paper prototype

This was a task to get us thinking about how to present our ideas in a really quick way without spending too much time obsessing over details. This is an example of a paper prototype of Super Mario. I tried to show as much of the detail as I can remember of the game, like the scrolling background, coins, enemies, etc. From here I will try to creat one from my own project.

## processing

This was the first time we started to work with sound in Processing to create a sort of volume-based visualiser. This is something that relates closely to something I would like to create and I was surprised how sound can be integrated with P5js.

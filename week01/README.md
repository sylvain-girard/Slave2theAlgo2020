# week 1
We started off with an intro into generative and parametric design. There were some particular examples by Ryoji Ikeda with [Test Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwjlYpJCBgk) and David Klein with [No Regrets](http://davidjklein.ca/No-Regrets) that really sparked my interest. We did a small group task relating to creating generative art, but in the more analog sense. We devised some parameters that would produce 'art' upon the rolling a dice. For each shape the dice would be rolled 4 times to determine the qualities of it, so this is an example of randomised art.
## These are our parameters for obtaining a visual outcome from rolling dice

After rolling the dice 60 times, we realised that this is where a computer algorithm would come in handy as it was taking us about 30 seconds for one shape, whereas a computer could simulate hundreds of dice rols instantly. This is something that I would known anyway, however actually partaking in the task really makes it obvious how cumbersome this 'analog' method is.

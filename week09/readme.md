# week 9



## hour of code

This week's coding session was particularly focused on typography and while it may not be useful for my project now, I'm already thinking of many future projects that could be done with these techniques. The below code is able to take a string of text and separate it into individual words that appear in time with the framecount. If the mouse goes close to the left of the window the words start to 'vibrate' within a random range. I like the effect of having some clean text that then becomes illegible when it starts to shake.

## continuing my code

At this stage I am working towards combining all my p5 sketches into the single, final sketch. Not all the elements are functioning perfectly yet, particularly the wavy lines that I want, but I will work on them as I go. Combining everything is proving to be a bit of a process, as I need to make sure all of the variables are called at the right stage; some only work when called in the draw function, and some should be called first or in the setup. I've also been converting everything into the HSB colour mode, so that I can map the colour to the frequencies in a more natural way, controlling the hue, saturation, and brightness as separate functions. The five circles at the top are just left in to monitor what all the frequencies are doing in different songs.

# stuff we did in week 5
## Pitch
In week 5 we all presented our piteches for our projects. My [Pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQyI2gfDF_hBUyya5y3rlEMoUVXuZHGCvwTR4Or96Hbf7ZHkhX3xWyuK5WMICxYi2Q5YAmAYaamJxwL/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=30000&slide=id.p) was focusing on Chromaesthesia and ways that this could be represented with an interactive web format. Essentially I plan to create a sort of visualiser, however it uses the various properties of sound as parameters for a number of visual reactions. Much like a person with chromaesthesia sees a specific colour for music notes. One of my stretch goals was to do this almost in reverse, being able to create sounds or music from an image. Karen reminded me of a man called Neil Harbisson, thhe world's forst cyborg, who uses an implant to be able to 'hear colours', which encompasses what I'd like to do quite well.

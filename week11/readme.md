# Week 11

[One attempt](https://sylvain-girard.github.io/Slave2theAlgo2020/week11/noiselines/) at finding the right method to create organic 'noise lines'

At this point in the project I was encountering many difficulties with the deadline looming. Naturally, when combining the sketch of an individual element into the main sketch with hundreds of lines of code, there will be some difficulty with making sure all the variables are there, there are no conflicting variables, everything of that nature. I couldn't figure out why my 'noise lines' were working fine in teir own sketch, but not in my main sketch. I started commenting out lines one by one and realised that I had made a mistake by calling the angle mode at the start rather than in set-up. From here on, the process was surprisingly smooth-sailing.
